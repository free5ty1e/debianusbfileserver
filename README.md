# debianusbfileserver
Debian scripts to support an rsync'd &amp;&amp; redundant USB file server (mine, but it might help you too) ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

To install: Make sure you are connected to the Internet, and copy / paste the following command into your terminal via a nice handy SSH session (or type it, whatever):
```
sudo apt-get -y install git && pushd ~ && rm -rf debianusbfileserver && git clone https://github.com/free5ty1e/debianusbfileserver.git && debianusbfileserver/scripts/installfiles.sh && popd && finishinstall.sh
```
